mkmine - Personalize the user experience on a unix or unix-like workstation

Originally by Ritchie Young - 6 Jan 2011

As a user of multiple computers, I would like to be able to quickly set up my work
environment in and get down to business.

These are scripts that do just that. Primarily setting up my shell and vim
configuration/plugins and ruby environments so that everything is just so.

Specifically, I use:

 - Bash, usually the default shell on the linux/os x
 - RVM to manage my Ruby interpreters
 - Bundler to manage my rubygems
 - Git for SCM
 - Vim as a text editor with the following plugins:
   - vim-ruby, vim-rails, fugitive 
 - Ruby on Rails for webapps
 - Ack and the Ack.vim plugin for recursive searching

Usage:

./install

This checks that you've already installed git, bash and curl and then installs the
remaining items.

If you like the look of these, please feel free to fork it on Github and
customize to suit yourself. Note, my name and details may appear several
times through-out the distribution. Recommend you:

 find home -exec grep -il ritchie {} \; -ls

And modify those files to insert your own details.


Best
Ritchie
